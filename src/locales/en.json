This demonstration represents results from KAIST research linked with Chungcheongnam-do's commissioned projects, showing how research outcomes connect to regional industries.</p><h2>6 Core Technologies Announced</h2><p>The demonstration featured commercialization-ready achievements developed in collaboration with faculty startup companies including <strong>Future EV Co. (CEO: Kim Kyung-soo)</strong>, <strong>DOCHAK Co. (CEO: Kim In-hee)</strong>, and alumni startup NOTA Co. (CEO: Chae Myung-soo), along with partner companies.</p><div class=\"key-technologies\"><h3>6 Core Technologies Unveiled</h3><ul><li><strong>Mobile Energy Storage System (ESS)</strong> Power Platform</li><li><strong>Naepo Digital Twin</strong></li><li><strong>SME-Specialized Autonomous Robots</strong></li><li><strong>Remote Driving Valet Parking</strong></li><li><strong>Autonomous Driving Testbed</strong></li><li><strong>AI Computing Center</strong></li></ul></div><h3>Technology Details</h3><p>The <strong>'Mobile Energy Storage System (ESS) Power Platform'</strong>, primarily developed by Professor Lee Yun-gu, is a solution that can build stable power grids even in areas where power supply is difficult, such as disaster sites or remote islands, proving the commercialization potential in the eco-friendly power sector.</p><p>The <strong>'Naepo Digital Twin'</strong> was commercialized through collaboration between Senior Researcher Kim Tae-kyun's research team and DOCHAK Co. It implements real cities and traffic situations in 3D virtual environments for traffic monitoring, situation prediction, disaster response, and policy verification, gaining attention as core technology for smart city construction.</p><p>The <strong>'SME-Specialized Autonomous Robot'</strong>, developed by Professor Kim Kyung-soo and Professor Choi Geun-ha's research team, is an autonomous logistics robot optimized for SME logistics environments. The demonstration showed precise movement and loading of factory logistics stations, confirming the innovation potential for small and medium manufacturing industries.</p><blockquote>The remote driving valet parking technology demonstrated a remotely controlled vehicle traveling from Daejeon to the Naepo Research Institute and completing destination parking, proving the stability and effectiveness of remote autonomous driving.</blockquote><p>The <strong>'Remote Driving Valet Parking Technology'</strong> is being commercialized through collaboration between Professor Kim In-hee and DOCHAK Co., Toronto Systems Co., E-Motion Co., and the national science and technology research network KREONET (operated by Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information).</p><p>The <strong>'Autonomous Driving Testbed'</strong> is a platform built by Professors Ahn Hee-jin and Noh Min-kyun, expanding scaled-car-based autonomous driving research results into educational and industrial demonstration platforms. The KAIST Mobility Research Institute plans to host the <strong>'2025 KAIST Mobility Challenge Competition'</strong> next year based on this platform, simultaneously promoting next-generation talent development and technology commercialization.</p><p>The <strong>'AI Computing Center'</strong> was unveiled by NOTA Co., which is preparing for KOSDAQ listing soon. The company introduced RE100-based power systems and AI optimization technologies, presenting collaboration visions with tenant companies and announcing goals to contribute to AI ecosystem expansion.</p><h2>Leadership Comments</h2><blockquote>KAIST Mobility Research Institute Director Jang Ki-tae stated, \"This demonstration showed the concrete process of KAIST research outcomes spreading to industrial sites,\" adding, \"We will continue to closely cooperate with local governments and companies to lead the commercialization of future mobility and AI technologies and regional industrial development.\"</blockquote><blockquote>KAIST President Lee Kwang-hyung emphasized, \"KAIST's mission is to contribute to the nation and local communities through technological innovation. We find it meaningful to see research outcomes creating practical changes in industrial sites, and will continue to lead global mobility innovation and new value creation through cooperation with companies and local governments.\"</blockquote>"
