    "missionText": "A KAIST-based startup, a key innovator in developing virtual environments for the mobility industry, was established in December 2024. Our expertise lies in creating precise, high-fidelity virtual simulations that maximize the safety and efficiency of autonomous systems. Our core technology allows us to accurately replicate complex real-world scenarios, including roads, traffic conditions, and various environmental variables. This capability helps overcome the significant time and cost constraints typically associated with physical testing. As a result, we can quickly and safely validate and improve the performance of next-generation mobility systems, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and UAM (Urban Air Mobility) solutions. Developed by KAIST researchers, our proprietary technology is accelerating the progress of future mobility solutions.",
