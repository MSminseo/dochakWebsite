## Quality Assurance Guidelines

### Criteria for Keeping Formatting:
1. **Product/Service Names**: Always keep formatted (e.g., "Life-Saving Robot", "Digital Twin")
2. **Key Statistics**: Preserve important numbers (e.g., "70% faster production")
3. **Core Capabilities**: Keep main function descriptions formatted
4. **Safety-Critical Terms**: Maintain formatting for safety-related terminology
5. **Unique Selling Points**: Preserve formatting for competitive advantages

### Criteria for Removing Formatting:
1. **Location References**: Remove formatting from city names, specific locations
2. **Generic Descriptors**: Remove from common adjectives like "advanced", "comprehensive"
3. **Technical Details**: Remove from minor technical specifications
4. **Redundant Terms**: Remove when similar concepts appear multiple times
5. **Process Details**: Remove from workflow or procedural descriptions

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review each section against the reduction targets
- [ ] Prioritize keeping product names and key benefits formatted
- [ ] Remove location-specific and generic descriptor formatting first
- [ ] Test readability after changes
- [ ] Verify that core value propositions remain clear
- [ ] Ensure no broken HTML tags after editing
- [ ] Validate JSON syntax after modifications

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:
- **Reduced visual clutter** while maintaining emphasis on key concepts
- **Improved readability** by focusing formatting on most important terms
- **Consistent emphasis** across all solution sections
- **Maintained marketing impact** for core value propositions
- **67% retention rate** of original formatting, meeting the 2/3 target goal

This plan systematically reduces HTML formatting from 190 to 127 elements (33% reduction) while preserving the most impactful and important formatted content.
